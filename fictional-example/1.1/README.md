# Fictional example

A work-in-progress fictional example designed to demonstrate the key features of OCDS.

This example was generated from the [OCDS 1.1 Sample Data Spreadsheet Input Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P-q5S8-WUxYT6t8uVuZDvnGfsl39DhhZV_GvgR1GKHk/edit#gid=159397949). To update the example, edit the sheets, then do steps 4 and 5 on the Instructions sheet to get the JSON data. Finally, run the `merge.py` script in this repository.
