# Flat Template

OCDS has [experimental support for flat CSV and spreadsheet serialisation of data](http://ocds.open-contracting.org/standard/r/1__0__0/en/key_concepts/serialization/#flat-csv-formats) using a template generated by the [Flatten Tool](https://github.com/OpenDataServices/flatten-tool)

This folder contains a blank set of CSV files and a spreadsheet.

## Using the templates

For each 'release' of data about a contracting process, create a row in the releases tab/file.

This should have a unique OCID and release ID. You will need these to cross reference back to the relevant release if you want to be able to construct full OCDS from these templates.

The majority of Planning, Tender and Buyer information can be expressed in the 'releases' sheet, as this only has a one-to-one relationship with release.

Awards and Contracts belong in separate sheets/files.

For places where one-to-many relationships exist (e.g. items), then a separate sheet/file is available.

Indicate which ocid, release and tender/award/contract etc. these relate to using the id columns at the start of those sheets/files.

You can hide/remove fields you don't need.

## Converting back to OCDS JSON

It should be possible to use the [Flatten Tool](https://github.com/OpenDataServices/flatten-tool) to convert from data entered into this spreadsheet to structured OCDS JSON data.

The hosted [CoVE tool](http://cove.opendataservices.coop/ocds/) currently provides an online interface for this which supports Spreadsheet->JSON conversion.
